# Sampler
Polyphonic Java Rompler (ROM-Sampler) that performs pitch shifting.  On-the-fly sampling, the ability to save and load samples during execution, and a GUI will be added in the future.

Pitches range from 0.5x to 2.0x the frequency of the original sample.

Unfortunately, cross-fading does not function correctly on many Linux systems due to control constraints imposed by Pulse Audio.
